The coordinate reference system is polygons which is {'init': 'epsg:3857'}. According to the metadata we can tell that it was compiled from the data thats US Census Bureau collectes as a part of the Master Address File. The unit consistency of the area of the data and combining similar areas into which fall under one name etc. are some of the data quality considerations which we had to take care of."

This can indicate that for areas within the promise zone, income level and geographic location are closely correlated with the ratio of healthy restaurants that exist in the area while the same cannot be said for areas outside of the promise zone. However, we should take pause in coming to this conclusion due to the fact that we had very little applicable healthy and non-healthy restaurant data, resulting in many healthy ratios ending up being 0 due to not having found any healthy or unhealthy restaurants in the business dataset. This could lead to reduced reliability in the conclusions we can draw from this regression study."
